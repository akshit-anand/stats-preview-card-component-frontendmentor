### What I learned

I learned how to change/reverse two sections position without changing the html with the help of css FlexBox property - **flex-direction: column-reverse**

```css
.card-container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column-reverse;
}
```

  These resources helped me to learn and understand html and css and helped in to complete the project
